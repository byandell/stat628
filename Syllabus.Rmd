This syllabus applies to different versions of Stat 628 for [Spring](Spring.Rmd) and [Summer](Summer.Rmd).

* query project meta-information about design and objectives
* articulate a plan of action
* communicate results clearly and succinctly

**Learning Objectives:** After completing this course, a student should be able to:

1. Connect statistical methods and theory concepts with data intuition using software tools
2. Organize small (or large) projects into manageable steps
3. Present and argue merits of data analysis using language and visuals accessible to a broad audience

**Computer software:** R, SAS and others.  
**Readings:** Reference materials will be provided online.  
**Assignments:** There will be periodic assignments.   
**Exams:** There will be no exams.  
**Grading:** Based on 80% homework and 20% class participation.  
Students will be evaluated by a series of written homework assignments, each having equal weight. In-class participation will be evaluated by degree of engagement with activities. Group members will provide written evaluation of other team members. 
Grading will be on a rough curve with expected 50% A, 25% AB, 25% B. A constitutes excellent comprehension; AB indicates strong showing with places for improvement; B signifies a basic but minimal understanding and ability to communicate results. Students performing below graduate level will receive C or lower grade.
